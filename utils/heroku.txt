Heroku and Github : Items could not be retrieved, Internal server error

1. Install the Heroku CLI if not yet installed
Further information about installation and setup can get here

2. Perform login with the heroku login command
You will be prompted with your default browser window for completing the login at the Heroku portal.

3. Assuming you already have your app set up at Heroku (if not, please follow this), you just need to add a new remote for your git repo with Heroku CLI.
Run heroku git:remote -a example-app - substitute "example-app" with your app name.

4. git remote -v to check if the remote has been set successfully
You should see something like this appear as a response

heroku  https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git (push)
5. Push your branch to the new heroku remote
git push heroku your_branch_name

6. You should see the progress of your deployment being displayed in the terminal
